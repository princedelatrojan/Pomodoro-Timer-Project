# Pomodoro Timer Project
 A Pomodoro Timer project in Python helps manage work and break intervals using the Pomodoro Technique. The script typically sets a timer for 25-minute work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks, with a longer break after every four work sessions. It tracks and displays the time remaining for each session, allowing users to stay focused and productive.
